# Consumer-Fraud-Detection-with-Tweets-

## Background
This is a capstone team project at NYU CUSP 2016. 

The project is sponsored by the office of Attorney General in New York state (OAG).

The project won the first prize in the capstone presentation at NYU CUSP 2016.

## Goal
Detect fraud situation (Most complained companies/industries, trend, location, topics) in New York state through multiple data sources (OAG internal data, Twitter data, CFPB financial complaint data) 

## Challenge
Pick up fraud relevant tweets from general tweets

Build a concise visualization tool with interaction for attorneys in OAG to detect fraud

## Data
Labled OAG internal complaint data (Confidencial)

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau(CFPB) Database

General Tweets scraped through twitter API  

## Implemented method/algorithm
transformation: Bag of word/ Tf-idf/ bigram

classification model: Support Vector Machine/ Random Forest/ Naive Bayes

topic model: LSA/ LDA

vector space model: Word2Vec

validation: n-fold cross validation

## Implemented python library
NLTK, Gensim, Lda, Sklearn, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Outcome
A classification model for labeling general tweets with fraud relevant or not, and industry category if fraud relevant

A vector space model for recognizing relationship(distance) between words from fraud narratives

A fraud detection visualization tool showing most complained companies/industries, fraud trend, location, and narratives. Find it here: https://vimeo.com/179412528
